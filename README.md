## üß™ 4. Multivariate Analysis

Multivariate Analysis involved visualizing one continuous variable (price) in relation to two or more categorical variables to identify deeper patterns.

---

### 1. Analysis of `sqft_living` across `bedrooms` and `price`

- Larger living areas correlate with higher prices, especially for homes with 3‚Äì5 bedrooms.
- Smaller homes (1‚Äì2 bedrooms) rarely exceed the \$1 million mark.

üìä  
![Distribution of sqft_living](images/EDA-distirbution%20of%20sqt.png)

---

### 2. Analysis of `sqft_above` vs. `grade` and `price`

- Higher grade homes usually have larger above-ground area.
- Grade is a strong indicator of both size and price.

üìä  
![Distribution of sqft_above](images/EDA-distribution%20of%20sqt-above.png)

---

### 3. Analysis of `yr_renovated` vs. `price` and `condition`

- Recently renovated homes have higher average prices.
- Most houses haven't been renovated (value = 0), yet those that are show a clear uplift in price.

üìä  
![Distribution of yr_renovated](images/EDA-distribution%20of%20yr_renovated.png)

---

### 4. Analysis of `waterfront` and `view` vs. `price`

- Waterfront properties fetch significantly higher prices.
- Better views (scale 3‚Äì4) also increase house value sharply.

![Distribution of waterfront](images/EDA-distirbution%20of%20waterfront.png)  
![Distribution of view](images/EDA-distirbution%20of%20view.png)

### 5. Analysis of `grade` vs. `price` and `sqft_living`

- `grade` and `sqft_living` are the most positively correlated features with `price`.
- Most homes fall within grade 7‚Äì10.

### 6 Correlation Matrix
The heatmap below shows the Pearson correlation between numerical features.
Key insights:
![Correlation Matrix](images/EDA-Correlation%20Matrix.png)

sqft_above also shows strong correlation with price.
#### üìà Top 5 Correlated Features with Price

| Feature        | Correlation with Price |
|----------------|------------------------|
| sqft_living    | 0.70                   |
| grade          | 0.67                   |

| view           | 0.40                   |


## 5. üì¶ Outliers

Outliers check was performed using Z-Score on key numerical fields such as `price`, `sqft_living`, and `sqft_lot`.  
No extreme outliers were removed, as most values fell within reasonable ranges.  
Some skewness was observed in `sqft_lot` and `price`, which were addressed via log transformation during **Feature Engineering**.

## üîö Conclusion

- `sqft_living`, `grade`, and `bathrooms` are the most influential **numerical features** affecting house prices.
- **Categorical features** such as `waterfront`, `view`, and `renovation status` create distinct price segments.
- **Multivariate patterns** show that combinations like high `grade` + large `living space` + `waterfront` significantly boost property value.
- **Geographical clustering** of high-value homes suggests the importance of incorporating location-based features into modeling.

### üîé Insights Recap

- Homes with a **waterfront**, **higher grade**, or **better view** tend to be priced significantly higher.
- `sqft_living` and `grade` have the **strongest correlation** with price.
- **Outliers** were identified in features such as `sqft_living`, `sqft_lot`, and `price`, requiring transformation or capping during preprocessing.

### üîó Correlation with Price (Pearson)

We visualized how each numeric feature correlates with `price` using a heatmap.

![Correlation with Price](images/Correlation%20with%20Price.png)

> `sqft_living`, `grade`, and `sqft_above` have the strongest positive correlations with price.

| Feature          | Justification                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `sqft_living`     | Strongest linear correlation with price |
| `grade`           | Most important in both tree models      |

# Classification 
## ü§ñ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) was used as a baseline model to predict housing prices. It is a simple, non-parametric method that relies on the similarity of neighboring data points.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

- Features were scaled using **MinMaxScaler** before training.
- K values from **1 to 20** were tested using the **validation set**.
- Performance was evaluated using:
  - **R¬≤ Score** (explained variance)
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

---

### üìà R¬≤ Score vs. Number of Neighbors (K)

The R¬≤ score peaked around **K = 6**, indicating the best generalization capability at that point.

![KNN R¬≤ Score](images/KNN-R2%20Score.png)

---

### üìâ RMSE vs. Number of Neighbors (K)

RMSE reached its minimum (~**165,800**) when **K = 6**, suggesting it as the optimal number of neighbors.

![KNN RMSE vs K](images/KNN-RMSE%20vs%20K.png)

---

### üî¢ Key Metrics (Best Performing K = 6)

| Metric       | Value     |
|--------------|-----------|
| **K**        | 6         |
| **R¬≤ Score** | 0.787     |
| **RMSE**     | 165,800   |

---

### üß† Insights

- KNN achieved a decent **R¬≤ score of 0.787** at **K=6**.
- Performance plateaued after **K > 6**, with minimal variation in results.
- Although effective as a benchmark, KNN:
  - **Lacks interpretability**
  - **Scales poorly** with large datasets (due to distance computation)

## üå≥ Decision Tree Regressor

The **Decision Tree Regressor** was used to understand feature splits and gain interpretability into how the model predicts house prices.

### üî¢ Top 10 Feature Importances

The most influential features according to the Decision Tree model are:

- `grade` (overall construction & design quality)
- `sqft_living` (interior living space)
- `lat` (latitude ‚Äì proxy for location)
- `long` (longitude)
- `waterfront` (whether the property has waterfront view)

### üå≤ Simplified Decision Tree (Max Depth = 2)

A simplified version of the trained tree reveals key decision rules learned by the model. The most frequent splits occurred on:

- `grade`
- `sqft_living`
- `lat`

üß† **Decision Tree Visualization**  
![Decision Tree](images/Decision%20Tree.png)

## üîç Logistic Regression with PCA

To visualize the classification and assess performance, a logistic regression model was trained using PCA-reduced features (first 2 principal components). PCA helped reduce dimensionality and allowed us to plot the decision space.

### üìå Confusion Matrix

This matrix evaluates the performance of the classifier:

- **True Positives (TP)**: 1721
- **True Negatives (TN)**: 1831
- **False Positives (FP)**: 339
- **False Negatives (FN)**: 429

Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed based on this confusion matrix.

![Confusion Matrix](images/Confusion%20Matrix.png)

### üìä PCA Projection of KC House Data

The PCA projection provides a 2D visualization of the data structure after dimensionality reduction. The model attempts to separate classes based on price category using logistic regression.

- Red: High-priced houses
- Blue: Low-priced houses

While overlap exists, we can see that PCA + Logistic Regression offers some level of linear separability.
